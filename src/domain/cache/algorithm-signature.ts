/**
 * Refactor-stable algorithm signature for the deterministic result cache.
 *
 * The battle engine is a pure function of (a) the data determinants the
 * {@link SimConfig} snapshot captures and (b) the algorithm itself — the pure
 * code that turns those determinants into frames. A manual integer version tag
 * (the old `ENGINE_ALGORITHM_VERSION`) had to be bumped by hand on every
 * computation-preserving-but-output-affecting refactor, which is easy to forget
 * and which also flushes the whole cache on a change that preserves the output.
 *
 * This module replaces that integer with a content-addressed signature derived
 * from the SIX canonical preset-determinism frame hashes pinned in
 * `engine.preset-determinism.unit.test.ts`. Those hashes are the single source
 * of truth: the test imports them from here, and the cache imports the digest
 * of their canonical serialisation from here.
 *
 * The signature is REFACTOR-STABLE. A change to engine code that does not alter
 * the six pinned frame hashes (the common case: a computation-preserving
 * optimisation, a renamed internal, a parallel-implementation A/B swap) leaves
 * the signature byte-identical, so the cache is RETAINED across the refactor.
 * A change that DOES alter any pinned hash (a real algorithm change) flips the
 * signature, so stale results are never served — exactly the contract the
 * manual bump gave, but derived from the same oracle the determinism test
 * guards, with no manual step.
 *
 * The signature is async because it hashes via `crypto.subtle.digest`, the only
 * hash available in both the browser and the Node test runtime. It is therefore
 * a CACHE-KEY TERM, not a `SimConfig` field: the snapshot stays synchronous.
