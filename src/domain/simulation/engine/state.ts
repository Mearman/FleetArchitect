/**
 * The battle loop's live mutable state, lifted out of `simulateBattle`'s

 *
 * This is purely a structural lift — the loop reads and writes exactly the same
 * values in exactly the same order as before — but having all authoritative live
 * state in one place is the foundation a checkpoint capture (later phases)
 * snapshots from and a resume restores into. Derived caches (path caches,
 * awareness, fingerprints) live on the ships and re-warm byte-identically on
 * first touch, so they are deliberately NOT part of this object.

/**
 * Every mutable quantity the battle loop reads and writes. Field meanings carry
 * over verbatim from the former generator locals:
 * - `ships` — every live SimShip, including phantoms (drones/decoys) and
 *   break-away chunks pushed in mid-run.
 * - `attackers` / `defenders` / `byId` — per-side views and the id index,
 *   rebuilt only when the `ships` array grows (see ./roster.ts).
 * - `deployment` — each side's centroid at the moment of deployment, captured
 *   once before any ship moves; blind fleets steer toward the opposing one.
 * - `projectiles` / `mines` / `pods` / `pulses` / `emissions` / `debris` /
 *   `beams` — the in-flight entity fields, advanced each tick. `beams` holds
 *   the energy-weapon beam emissions (hitscan visual events) that linger for
 *   a few ticks so the renderer can draw them.
 * - the `*Seq` counters — monotonic per-battle id counters; a same-seed run
 *   produces the same ids because they advance in the same spawn order.
 * - `emissionSeq` — the monotonic EM-emission counter, threaded across ticks.
 * - `ticks` — count of post-initial frames yielded (excludes the tick-0 frame).
 * - `winner` / `resolved` — the outcome and whether it was decided in-loop.
